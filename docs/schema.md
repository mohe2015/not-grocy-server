# Common things

row_created_timestamp, undone, undone_timestamp, active

id, name, description

also that many tables have the table and a logging table

for types question mark means can be null.

all tinyints to booleans (for postgres)

enums in postgres

bool (maybe some bools are nullable - then also fix that)

# userobjects

where is this in the hierarchy?

don't understand where userobjects and userfields belongs

maybe it's something completely different

maybe to add additional fields to the other things

## id

## userentity_id

probably foreign key userentities(id)

## row_created_timestamp
